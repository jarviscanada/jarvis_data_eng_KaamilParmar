# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Computer Science graduate from York University with a passion for coding, software development, and technology. Throughout my education at York University, I developed strong analytical, problem-solving, and coding skills. Additionally, I also cultivated a strong understanding of fundamental topics such as data structures, algorithms, and software design. Prior to Jarvis, I acquired valuable experience in the software industry through contract work, specializing in full stack development. I successfully contributed to the development of web applications, showcasing expertise in building robust and scalable software. The most notable of these is my work at InspoBoard as a full stack developer, where I helped develop a SaaS analytics tool utilized by ad agencies and businesses. By leveraging my solid academic foundation in Computer Science and my established track record as a developer, I am confident to take on a role that demands technical expertise and utilization of a diverse range of technologies.
