  "summary": "Hey there, I'm Kaamil! I am a Computer Science graduate from York University with a passion for coding, software development, and technology. Prior to Jarvis, I've gotten experience in the software industry through contract work, honing my skills in full stack development. Primarily building MVPs using MERN stack for startup companies. What truly excites me is the opportunity to contribute to building applications that make a real-world impact. There's a passion in problem-solving through code, it's like unraveling a complex puzzle, and the satisfaction of seeing lines of logic come to life is unbeatable. From my experience, I am experienced in Full Stack Development, but am also eager to take on other roles after my experience at Jarvis."
