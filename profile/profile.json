It utilizes a third-party API (Vantage) to collect real-time stock market data in JSON format and then converts JSON data into Java objects and parses them into a PostgreSQL server. The application relies on OkHttp for making HTTP requests to VantageAPI and Jackson library for processing JSON data. All requests are stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is running in a Docker container. To ensure the accuracy of the program, the application includes a comprehensive amount of unit and integration tests. This was accomplished using tools and libraries such as JUnit, Mockito, and log4j Logger. The app is controlled and utilized by the user through the console.",
