# Linux Cluster Modeling
## Introduction
This project involved the development of a monitoring system to record hardware specifications and usage, 
storing the data in a database. The project's users are individuals managing machine clusters for diverse 
projects, aiding them in deciding whether to scale vertically or horizontally based on their requirements. 
The implementation leveraged Bash, Docker, Postgres, and Git. Testing was conducted manually on a CentOS virtual 
machine within the Google Cloud Platform. Additionally, crontab was employed to schedule regular data collection tasks.
