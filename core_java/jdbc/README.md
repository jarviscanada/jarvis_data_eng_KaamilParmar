# Introduction
The Stockquote app is a Java application designed to facilitate real-time stock trading. 
It utilizes a third-party API to retrieve stock market data in JSON format, 
which is then parsed into Java objects for further processing. 
The app takes advantage of modern libraries such as OkHttp for seamless HTTP 
requests and Jackson for efficient JSON parsing all of which was done by using Maven for development and 
project management. To ensure code reliability, the project incorporates comprehensive unit and integration testing. 
Additionally, the app stores requests in a PostgreSQL database, 
which is hosted within a Docker container.
