# Introduction
This Java Grep App emulates the Linux command line tool "grep", which allows for cross-platform usage of it beyond Linux
through Java implementation. It was developed using core Java 8 and managed with Maven for dependency handling, 
compilation, and project organization. Moreover, the app provides two kinds of implementation. One relies on traditional
language features, including for loops, whilst the other leverages lambda functions and Stream APIs to replace tradition
Java coding conventions, offering a more concise and memory-efficient alternative. Users can choose between the two 
implementations based on their preferences. Finally, testing with jUnit and utilization of a logger class ensures the 
reliability and accuracy of both implementations.
